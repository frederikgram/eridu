# Eridu
My first _full_ attempt at creating a compiled language.  As this
is the first language that I'm intending to fully implement, I do not intend for this to be complex
nor super impressive.

## (F)lex, Yacc, Bison ...
I'm not quite sure yet, whether or not to make a "first implementation" using
tooling, and then try and work from those, or if I should try and create the entire
codebase using from-scratch code. 

Using tools seems to be a better way of learning the ecosystem of Language Design,
however, I'd be cooler to say I made everything myself.

I should definitely write the Lexer myself, as trying my hand at writing a Regex
based lexer instead of my usual finite-state-machine lexer would be neat, as I write
a lot of lexers, and it would speed up future projects quite a lot.
